SSHAdmin
========

This is a project to send simple commands and execute scripts in the users .cripts directory, on SSH enabled servers. 
Be aware that it has only been tested on Debian 6 servers and the app has a tendency to crash when sending commands.





To Do
=====
- Add a local database.
- Improve the design.
- Add more default commands.
- Add the possibility to edit servers and commands.




Background
==========

This project was a part of my education at UCN Aalborg, where I had to develop an application by myself during a course of several weeks. Note that this project is my first experience with Objective C, and thus this should not be used for anything without major improvements first.
